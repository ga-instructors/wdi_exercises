#Fun with Strings and Substrings

###Overview:

* Let's prep for an interview.

###Spec:

##Part 1:

In ***Ruby***, write a method `find_substring` that takes a `string` and a `substring` as its arguments.  If the substring is contained within the string, the method should return an index corresponding to the position of the substring inside of the string.  Otherwise, it should return false. For example: 
```ruby

find_substring("groovy", "oo")
=> 2

find_substring("far out", "ar")
=> 1

find_substring("purple pie pete", "pumpkin")
=> false


```

##You are not allowed to use any methods bearing the word 'index'

##Part 2: 

In ***JavaScript***, write the same method.
