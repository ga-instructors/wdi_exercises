###Spec:
* The user should be asked to guess a number
* If the user's guess is correct, the user should see a congratulatory message
* If the user's guess is not correct, the user should be asked to guess the number again.

###Activity:
- Students should work on this lab in groups.
- Students should be given `guess_the_number-prompt.rb` as a starting point, with `guess_the_number-solution.rb` as the ideal coded solution
