#Favorite Things

###Learning Objective: 
...understand the different basic data types in JavaScript, and the use of "var"

###Overview:
This exercise (which is so short as to perhaps more appropriately be billed as a drill) is an introduction to working with arrays in JavaScript.

###Spec:
* Create an array that contains a few of your favorite things (fruits, vegetables, colors, sports teams, whatever).
* Write some code in JavaScript that outputs strings like (for an array of arbitrary length):
	* My #1 favorite baseball team is the New York Mets.
	* My #2 favorite baseball team is the San Francisco
* Bonus:
	* Change the output to:
		* My 1st favorite baseball team is the New York Mets.
		* My 2nd favorite baseball team is the San Francisco Giants.
