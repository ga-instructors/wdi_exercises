#Moody People

###Learning Objective: 
...correctly define and manipulate a JavaScript object, and describe the word "this" and how it changes based on object context

###Overview:
Create objects in Javascript with methods.

###Spec:
* Create an array of 5 person objects
	* A person should have attributes including name, age, and mood
	* A person should be able to `introduce` itself
		* This introduction should reflect their mood
		* For example:
			* If the person is happy, their introduction may be
				* 'Hi!  I am Bob!  Pleased to meet you!'
			* If the person is unhappy, their introduction may be
				* 'hi...  Bob here...'
	* Note: How to implement mood is your decision.  It could be strings like 'happy' or 'unhappy' or it also could be a range of 0 to 10, where 10 is best mood ever and 0 is worst mood ever.  Your choice here.
