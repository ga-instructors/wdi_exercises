#Smoothies

###Learning Objective: ...understand the different basic data types and how work with them to discern when to use the right one

###Overview:
* Practice working with arrays, strings, and a basic object

###Spec:
* Given a hash of ingredients, write a function called `blend`.
	* It should take all the smoothie ingredients (not the measurements) and chop up and mix all the characters and output a mixed string of characters
	* Be sure to remove the spaces, as we don't want any air bubbles in our smoothie!
* Create a class called `Blender`
	* It should have a method that takes an array of ingredients and returns a mixed string of characters (`blend`).
	* Give the blender an on and off switch and only allow the blender to function when it's on.
	* FOR SAFETY'S SAKE When you create a new blender by default it should be off.
	* Blend the the smoothie array
