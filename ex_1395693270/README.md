#CizzUrp

###Overview:
Get familiar with JavaScript constructor functions and prototypes!

###Spec:
####Part 1
* Create a `BoyPopStar` constructor in Javascript. 
* It should take in a `name` and `haircut` when the constructor function is called and set those attributes on the generated object.
* The constructor should also have a `learnMoves` function that accepts a new dance move and stores it in an array assigned to the objects `moves` attribute.


####Part 2
* Write a `cizzurp` function that takes an argument `n`
* It should iterates through all numbers from 1 to n, printing one of the following strings: 
	* If the number is evenly divisible by 3, it should print `cizz`.
	* If the number is evenly divisibly by 5, it should print `urp`. 
	* If the number is evenly divisibly by 3 and 5, it should print `cizzurp`.
	* Otherwise, it should just print the number.
* Assign the cizzurp method to the objects prototype.
