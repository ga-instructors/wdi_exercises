#Box Movement

###Overview:
Lets use JQuery to animate a box on our DOM.

###Spec:
* Create an `index.html`, a `stylesheets` folder, and a `javascripts` folder.  Get your `index` set up with all the basic elements required to see a page
* Give `index.html` a background color of your choosing
* Make a box on `index.html`
	* It should be 20px in height and 20px in width.  Give it a color of your choosing.   
* Use jQuery for the following:
	* Make it so that if I press the **up** key, the box will move up by a certain amount (you decide exactly how much).  If I press the **down** key, the box will move down by that same amount  	
	* Do the same for the **left** and **right** keys
* ***BONUS:*** 
	* If I press a numbered key (1*9), make the screen flash a random color that many times
